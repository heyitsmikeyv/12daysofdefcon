# 12daysofdefcon
a silly song we wrote
-----
On the twelfth day of DEF CON, my true love gave to me

twelve speakers speaking,

eleven hashes cracking,

ten pickers picking,

nine goons a-trolling,

eight doxxers doxxing,

seven guards a-knocking,

six stickers sticking,

**FIVE POOL PARTIES**

four c and d's,

three hours' sleep,

two rogue ATMs,

and my password on the wall of sheep.
